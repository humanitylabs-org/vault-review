# Spellbook — Spaced Repetition for Ideas

A self-hosted spaced repetition app that resurfaces ideas at increasing intervals. Unlike traditional Anki, this is designed for **idea integration** — revisiting concepts so they connect with new experiences over time.

## Quick Start

### Start the server

```bash
python3 <skill_dir>/scripts/server.py --port 8787
```

The app is available at `http://localhost:8787`. On first run, it creates `cards.json` from example cards and an empty `review-state.json`.

### Custom data directory

```bash
python3 <skill_dir>/scripts/server.py --port 8787 --dir /path/to/my/cards
```

## Card Format

Cards live in `cards.json` — an array of objects:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "unique-slug",
    "domain": "Category Name",
    "title": "Card Title",
    "content": "Markdown content with **bold**, *italic*, lists, etc.",
    "releaseDate": "2026-01-15"
  }
]
```

- `id`: Unique identifier (kebab-case slug)
- `domain`: Category for grouping (e.g., "Philosophy", "AI", "Business")
- `title`: Display title
- `content`: Markdown-formatted content (rendered in the app)
- `releaseDate`: When the card becomes available for review

## Agent Workflows

### Adding cards from conversation

When the user says something like "add this to my review deck" or "I want to remember this":

1. Read the current `cards.json`
2. Generate a card with a unique `id`, appropriate `domain`, clear `title`, and markdown `content` that captures the key insight
3. Append to the array and write back
4. Confirm: "Added card '{title}' to your review deck in {domain}"

### Generating cards from content

When given an article, transcript, or notes to turn into cards:

1. Identify 3-7 key insights worth revisiting
2. Each card should capture ONE idea clearly
3. Write content that's useful on re-read — not just a fact, but context for why it matters
4. Set `releaseDate` to today for immediate availability

### Card quality guidelines

**Good cards:**
- Capture an insight you'd want to revisit in 2 weeks
- Include enough context to be useful standalone
- Provoke thought, not just recall
- ~50-200 words of content

**Bad cards:**
- Raw facts without context
- Too long (>300 words) — split into multiple cards
- Too vague to be actionable on re-read

## Review State

`review-state.json` tracks per-card review history:

```json
{
  "card-id": {
    "interval": 1440,
    "ease": 2.5,
    "reps": 3,
    "due": 1709251200000,
    "lastReview": 1709164800000
  }
}
```

The app handles all scheduling logic. Don't modify review-state.json directly unless resetting a card.

## Rating System

Users rate cards 0-3:
- **Again (0):** Show again soon — didn't connect
- **Hard (1):** Recognized but needs more review
- **Good (2):** Connected, schedule normally
- **Easy (3):** Deeply integrated, push out further

## PWA Setup

For mobile home screen access:
1. Open `http://localhost:8787` (or Tailscale URL) in mobile browser
2. "Add to Home Screen" — creates an app icon
3. Opens as a standalone app without browser chrome

## Tips

- The server auto-creates `cards.json` from example cards on first run
- Cards support full markdown including lists, bold, italic, and links
- Review state persists via PUT to the server — survives page refreshes
- The app works offline after initial load (state syncs on next connection)
